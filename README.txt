PoE ScamBot is tool for maintaining a live search of the Path of
Exile stash tab API. Unlike some other indexers, such as poe.trade or
poe.ninja, ScamBot does not track historical data and is only a
lightweight parser. Thus, an item may show up multiple times if a
player modified other items in the stash. ScamBot is intended for
searching for items with specific names, such as uniques, maps, and
currency, and not magic or rare items.

Usage:
1. Run scambot.pyw

2. Under the default settings, simply input the search terms
   (separated by a comma and a space) and the desired league, max
   price, min price, and currency then press "Start". The app will
   automatically start searching for items with the search terms
   included in the item names and with the desired price in the
   desired league.

3. Start playing Path of Exile.

4. When the app finds a result, it will play a tone and copy a
   whisper message to your clipboard.

5. Paste the message into chat and profit!
